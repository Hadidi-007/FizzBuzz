# FizzBuzz
Android FizzBuzz application sample

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test given in coding interviews. The task is simple: Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

This app demonstrates multiple fragments in an activity, a shared ViewModel across fragments, data binding, LiveData, and the Jetpack Navigation component as well as dark / light mode.
